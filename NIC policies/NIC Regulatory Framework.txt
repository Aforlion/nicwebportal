Facility accreditation is what will *legitimize NIC nationally* and separate it from training-only organizations.

I’ll approach this as a **regulatory framework**, not just a checklist. You can later turn this directly into:

* Website content
* Inspection forms
* Digital compliance workflows
* Policy documents
